The program takes 3 inputs:

  * Material type
  * Item type
  * Enchantment level

It then runs through what I understand to be the official minecraft enchantment algorithm (as detailed on the wiki - http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Enchanting). It then calculates a set of enchantments you might get for a given run, with what should be the same probability.

There is also the option to run through the algorithm 1000 times, estimating the probability of getting a particular enchantment.

Feel free to modify if the rules ever change

Enjoy :)
